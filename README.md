# Phrase Hunter
Guess the hidden phrase before you run out of lives.

## Motivation
This is the fourth project in the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program (version 2).

## Features
* The player chooses letters to try to identify the secret phrase.
* If the selected letter is in the phrase it will be revealed.
* If the selected letter is not in the phrase the player will lose one life.
* The player starts with five lives, as shown by the heart images at the bottom.
* The player wins if they uncover all of the letters in the phrase.
* The player loses if they run out of lives.
* At the conclusion of the game a screen will notify the player if they won or lost and allow them to play again.
* The player can select letters by clicking on the onscreen keyboard or by pressing keys on their physical keyboard.

## Future Improvements
* Improve and expand upon the styling of the app.
* Add animations to the application.
